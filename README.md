# International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) Conference Data Exploration

The aim of this project is to investigate the dynamics of the ICSE papers over a seven-year span surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. The project involves collecting and preprocessing conference paper data, dividing it into three periods (3 years before COVID-19, during COVID-19, and 3 years after COVID-19), and conducting comprehensive analyses. These analyses include temporal trends, topic modeling, paper clustering, author collaboration networks, and impact assessments. The project will culminate in the development of an interactive web-based interface that allows users to explore and visualize the evolving research landscape, contributing valuable insights into the impact of COVID-19 on academic research in the ICSE community.



Include a dataset of the accepted papers in ACM FSE and IEEE/ACM ICSE during the last 5 years (2019–2023). The dataset is complemented with some Python code aiming to answer the following:

•	**RQ1**: How have the research topics within ICSE conference papers evolved over the specified time periods, and what are the prominent research themes within each period?


•	**RQ2**: Are there specific geographic, institutional, or thematic patterns in author collaborations that have emerged in response to the COVID-19 pandemic?


•	**RQ3**: What are the key insights into the impact of COVID-19 on academic research trends, and how have these trends influenced the publication landscape in ICSE conferences?
