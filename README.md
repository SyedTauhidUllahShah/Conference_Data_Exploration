# Conference_Data_Exploration
Include a dataset of the accepted papers in ACM FSE and IEEE/ACM ICSE during the last 5 years (2019-2023). The dataset is complemented with some Python code aiming to answer the following,

•	**RQ1**: How have the research topics within ICSE conference papers evolved over the specified time periods, and what are the prominent research themes within each period?
•	**RQ2**: Are there specific geographic, institutional, or thematic patterns in author collaborations that have emerged in response to the COVID-19 pandemic?
•	**RQ3**: What are the key insights into the impact of COVID-19 on academic research trends, and how have these trends influenced the publication landscape in ICSE conferences?
